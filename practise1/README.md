Your unofficial guidebook to shell programming

## Programs for practise-1

Write scripts for following programs yourself, if you are not able to solve them you can see the code.

### Program 1

Write a shell script that prints "Hello World!" to the screen.

[See the code here!](./prog1.sh)

### Program 2

Assign some message to a variable and display that variable to screen.

[See the code here!](./prog2.sh)

### Program 3

Store the value of `date` command in a variable and display the message "Today is: _______" where, `_____` represents output of `date` command.

[See the code here!](./prog3.sh)

### Program 4

### Program 7
